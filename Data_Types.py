list = [1,2,3] # every item has his own index. this is mutable
set = {1,2,2,3} # every item is unique. this will give the output of: 2,1,3. the order of the elements is random. this is mutable.
tupple = (1,2,3) #  this is immutable (so it cant change). every item has his own index.
boolean = True # or False. (True = 1 | false = 0)
string = "string" # letters.
none = None # like null. this is useful when we want to make a variable and we dont want to give him a value yet.
